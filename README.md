How to run make:
navigate to the src file that contains ReaderWriterSem.c
run the command "make fcfs"

I didnt think that the numbers on the reader and writer would be a big deal or lose us points
So i didnt update those, because right now it works, its just that the numbers are based off of
"i" in the loop
